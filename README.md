#  ![](https://github.com/Serzhenka/hyper-loop-logos/blob/master/hyper-router_150.png)Hyper-router

The Hyperloop Router allows you write and use the React Router in Ruby through Opal.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'hyper-router'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

This is simply a DSL wrapper on [react-router](....)

### DSL

The following DSL:

```ruby
route("/", mounts: App, index: Home) do
  route("about")
  route("inbox") do
    redirect('messages/:id').to { | params | "/messages/#{params[:id]}" }
  end
  route(mounts: Inbox) do
    route("messages/:id")
  end
end
```

Is equivalent to this route configuration:

```javascript
const routes = {
  path: '/',
  component: App,
  indexRoute: { component: Dashboard },
  childRoutes: [
    { path: 'about', component: About },
    {
      path: 'inbox',
      component: Inbox,
      childRoutes: [{
        path: 'messages/:id',
        onEnter: ({ params }, replace) => replace(`/messages/${params.id}`)
      }]
    },
    {
      component: Inbox,
      childRoutes: [{
        path: 'messages/:id', component: Message
      }]
    }
  ]
}
```

The basic dsl syntax is designed with the following in mind:

1. Most routes have a path so that is the assumed first argument.
2. Use `mounts` rather than component (reads better?)
3. Convention over configuration, given a path, the component name can be derived.
4. Redirect takes the path, and a block (similar to the JSX DSL)
5. The first param to route can be skipped per the documentation
6. Use standard ruby lower case method names instead of caps (reserve those for components)

The above example does not cover all the possible syntax, here are the other methods and options:

#### enter / leave / change transition hooks

for adding an onEnter or onLeave hook you would say:

```ruby
route("foo").on(:leave) { | t | ... }.on(:enter) { | t |.... }
```
which follows the react.rb event handler convention.

A `TransitionContext` object will be passed to the handler, which has the following methods:

| method | available on | description |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| `next_state` | `:change`, `:enter` | returns the next state object |
| `prev_state` | `:change` | returns the previous state object |
| `replace` | `:change`, `:enter` | pass `replace` a new path |
| `promise` | `:change`, `:enter` | returns a new promise.  multiple calls returns the same promise |

If you return a promise from the `:change` or `:enter` hooks, the transition will wait till the promise is resolved before proceeding.  For simplicity you can call the promise method, but you can also use some other method to define the promise.

The hooks can also be specified as proc values to the `:on_leave`, `:on_enter`, `:on_change` options.

#### multiple component mounting

The `mounts` option can accept a single component, or a hash which will generate a `components` (plural) react-router prop, as in:

`route("groups", mounts: {main: Groups, sidebar: GroupsSidebar})` which is equivalent to:

`{path: "groups", components: {main: Groups, sidebar: GroupsSidebar}}` (json) or

`<Route path="groups" components={{main: Groups, sidebar: GroupsSidebar}} />` JSX

#### The `mounts` option can also take a `Proc` or be specified as a block

The proc is passed a TransitionContext (see **Hooks** above) and may either return a react component to be mounted, or return a promise.  If a promise is returned the transition will wait till the promise is either resolved with a component, or rejected.

`route("courses/:courseId", mounts: -> () { Course }`

is the same as:

```jsx
<Route path="courses/:courseId" getComponent={(nextState, cb) => {cb(null, Course)}} />
```

Also instead of a proc, a block can be specified with the `mounts` method:

`route("courses/:courseId").mounts { Course }`

Which generates the same route as the above.

More interesting would be something like this:

```ruby
route("courses/:id").mounts do | ct |
  HTTP.get("validate-user-access/courses/#{ct.next_state[:id]}").then {  Course }
end
```

*Note that the above works because of promise chaining.*

You can use the `mount` method multiple times with different arguments as an alternative to passing the the `mount` option a hash:

`route("foo").mount(:baz) { Comp1 }.mount(:bar) { Comp2 }.mount(:bomb)`

Note that if no block is given (as in `:bomb` above) the component name will be inferred from the argument (`Bomb` in this case.)

#### The index component can be specified as a proc

Same deal as mount...

`route("foo", index: -> { MyIndex })`

#### The index method

Instead of specifying the index component as a param to the parent route, it can be specified as a child using the
index method:

```ruby
route("/", mounts: About, index: Home) do
  index(mounts: MyIndex)
  route("about")
  route("privacy-policy")
end
```

This is useful because the index method has all the features of a route except that it does not take a path or children.

#### The `redirect` options

with static arguments:

`redirect("/from/path/spec", to: "/to/path/spec", query: {q1: 123, q2: :abc})`

the `:to` and `:query` options can be Procs which will receive the current state.

Or you can specify the `:to` an `:query` options with blocks:

`redirect("/from/path/spec/:id").to { |curr_state| "/to/path/spec/#{current_state[:id]}"}.query { {q1: 12} }`

#### The `index_redirect` method

just like `redirect` without the first arg: `index_redirect(to: ... query: ...)`

### The Router Component

A router is defined as a subclass of `Hyperloop::Router` which is itself a `Hyperloop::Component`.

```ruby
class Components::Router < Hyperloop::Router
  def routes # define your routes (there is no render method)
    route("/", mounts: About, index: Home) do
      route("about")
      route("inbox") do
        redirect('messages/:id').to { | params | "/messages/#{params[:id]}" }
      end
      route(mounts: Inbox) do
        route("messages/:id")
      end
    end
  end  
end
```
#### Mounting your Router
You will mount this component the usual way (i.e. via `render_component`, `Element#render`, `react_render`, etc) or even by mounting it within a higher level application component.

```ruby
class Components::App < Hyperloop::Component
  render(DIV) do
    Application::Nav()
    MAIN do
      Router()
    end
  end
end
```

#### navigating

Create links to your routes with `Router::Link`
```ruby
#Application::Nav
  LI.nav_link { TestRouter::Link("/") { "Home" } }
  LI.nav_link { TestRouter::Link("/about") { "About" } }
  params.messsages.each do |msg|
    LI.nav_link { TestRouter::Link("/inbox/messages/#{msg.id}") { msg.title } }
  end
```

Additionally, you can manipulate the history with by passing JS as so
```ruby
# app/views/components/app_links.rb
class Components::AppLinks
  class << self
    if RUBY_ENGINE == 'opal'
      def inbox
        `window.ReactRouter.browserHistory.push('/inbox');`
      end
      def message(id)
        `window.ReactRouter.browserHistory.push('/messages/#{id}');`
      end
    end
  end
end
```


#### Other router hooks:

There are several other methods that can be redefined to modify the routers behavior

#### history

```ruby
class Router < Hyperloop::Router
  def history
  ... return a history object
  end
end
```

The two standard history objects are predefined as `browser_history` and `hash_history` so you can say:

```ruby
...
  def history
    browser_history
  end
```

or just

```ruby
...
  alias_method :history :browser_history
```

#### create_element

`create_element` (if defined) is passed the component that the router will render, and its params.  Use it to intercept, inspect and/or modify the component behavior.

`create_element` can return any of these values:

+ Any falsy value: indicating that rendering should continue with no modification to behavior.
+ A `React::Element`, or a native `React.Element` which will be used for rendering.
+ Any truthy value: indicating that a new Element should be created using the (probably modified) params

```ruby
class Router < Hyperloop::Router
  def create_element(component, component_params)
    # add the param :time_stamp to each element as its rendered
    React.create_element(component, component_params.merge(time_stamp: Time.now))
  end
end
```

The above could be simplified to:

```ruby
...
  def create_element(component, component_params)
    component_params[:time_stamp] = Time.now
  end
```

Just make sure that you return a truthy value otherwise it will ignore any changes to component or params.

Or if you just wanted some kind of logging:

```ruby
...
  def create_element(component, component_params)
    puts "[#{Time.now}] Rendering: #{component.name}" # puts returns nil, so we are jake mate
  end
```

The component_params will always contain the following keys as native js objects, and they must stay native js objects:

+ `children`
+ `history`
+ `location`
+ `params`
+ `route`
+ `route_params`
+ `routes`

We will try to get more fancy with a later version of reactrb-router ;-)

#### `stringify_query(params_hash)` <- needs work

The method used to convert an object from <Link>s or calls to transitionTo to a URL query string.

```ruby
class Router < Hyperloop::Router
  def stringify_query(params_hash)
    # who knows doc is a little unclear on this one...is it being passed the full params_hash or just
    # the query portion.... we shall see...
  end
end
```

#### `parse_query_string(string)` <- needs work

The method used to convert a query string into the route components's param hash

#### `on_error(data)`

While the router is matching, errors may bubble up, here is your opportunity to catch and deal with them. Typically these will come when promises are rejected (see the DSL above for returning promises to handle async behaviors.)

#### `on_update`

Called whenever the router updates its state in response to URL changes.

#### `render`

A `Router` default `render` looks like this:

```ruby
  def render
    # Router.router renders the native router component
    Router.router(build_params)
  end
```


This is primarily for integrating with other libraries that need to participate in rendering before the route components are rendered. It defaults to render={(props) => <RouterContext {...props} />}.

Ensure that you render a <RouterContext> at the end of the line, passing all the props passed to render.

### Hyperloop::Router::Component

The class Hyperloop::Router::Component is a subclass of Hyperloop::Component that predefines the params that the router will be passing in to your component.  This includes

`params.location`

The current location.

`params.params`

The dynamic segments of the URL.

`params.route`

The route that rendered this component.

`params.route_params`

The subset of `params.params` that were directly specified in this component's route. For example, if the route's path is `users/:user_id` and the URL is /users/123/portfolios/345 then `params.route_params` will be `{user_id: '123'}`, and `params.params` will be `{user_id: '123', portfolio_id: 345}`.
